/**
 * A utility class for managing a group of CUDA streams with an immutable list
 * of streams. This class allows the creation, iteration, and synchronized
 * closure of a set of CUDA streams. It also implements {@link AutoCloseable}
 * for automatic resource cleanup, ensuring that the streams are destroyed when
 * they are no longer needed.
 *
 
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * try (StreamGroup streamGroup = new StreamGroup(10)) {
 *     streamGroup.forEach(stream -> {
 *         // Perform operations with the stream
 *     });
 * }
 * </pre>
 
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: The streams are automatically synchronized and destroyed when the
 * {@link #close()} method is called, either explicitly or implicitly via the
 * try-with-resources statement.</p>
